### Featured Projects

#### Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones

1. **Classification with PCA**: Compare the accuracy of **Gradient Boosting Classifier** and **Logistic Regression** with and without PCA dimensionality reduction across varying numbers of components.
2. **K-Means Clustering**: Apply K-Means clustering to the dataset and evaluate cluster quality using the **Silhouette Score**.
3. **Visualization**: Leverage PCA to project high-dimensional data into 1D, 2D, and 3D spaces for visual exploration of cluster structure.
